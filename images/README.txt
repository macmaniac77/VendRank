Product images (e.g., 1.png, 2.png, etc.) should be placed in this 'images' directory.
Each product image filename (without the .png extension) must correspond to an 'id' in the 'slotConfig' array defined within 'index.html'.

These images are used by the JavaScript in 'index.html' to display products on the vending machine canvas.
For more details on the product overlay feature and customization, please see the main README.md file in the root directory of this project.
